`aioguardian` is a Python3, `asyncio`-friendly library for interacting with
[the Guardian line of water valves and sensors from Elexa](http://getguardian.com).

# Installation

```python
pip install aioguardian
```

# Python Versions

`aioguardian` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8 

# Usage

## Sync (Normal) Usage

```python
from aioguardian import Client
from aioguardian.errors import GuardianError


# Create a client with the IP address or hostname of your Guardian device:
client = Client("192.168.1.100")

try:
    ping_response = client.device.ping()
except GuardianError as err:
    print(f"There was an error: {err}")
```

## Async Usage

To use the library in an `asyncio`-friendly way, simply pass the `use_async` parameter when
creating a client. From there, the same methods can be used, but now as coroutines:

```python
import asyncio

from aioguardian import Client
from aioguardian.errors import GuardianError


# Create a client with the IP address or hostname of your Guardian device:
client = Client("192.168.1.100", use_async=True)

try:
    ping_response = await client.device.ping()
except GuardianError as err:
    print(f"There was an error: {err}")


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
```

## Commands

Many API calls are available:

* `client.device.diagnostics()`: return diagnostics info from the device
* `client.device.factory_reset()`: perform a factory reset of the device
* `client.device.ping()`: ping the device to determine whether it can be reached
* `client.device.reboot()`: reboot the device
* `client.device.upgrade_firmware()`: initiate a firmware upgrade on the device

Details on how to use each operation can be found in the docstrings for the various
methods; similarly, the test fixtures demonstrate the various types of JSON responses
you can anticipate.
