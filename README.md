`aioguardian` is a Python3, `asyncio`-focused library for interacting with
[the Guardian line of water valves and sensors from Elexa](http://getguardian.com).

# Installation

```python
pip install aioguardian
```

# Python Versions

`aioguardian` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8 

# Usage

```python
import asyncio

from aioguardian import Client
from aioguardian.errors import GuardianError


async with Client("192.168.1.100") as client:
    # Run various commands:
    await client.device.ping()
    await client.device.diagnostics()


asyncio.run(main())
```

If the mood should strike you, you can manually instantiate a `Client` object and manage
connection to and disconnection from the device yourself:

```python
import asyncio

from aioguardian import Client
from aioguardian.errors import GuardianError


# Create a client with the IP address or hostname of your Guardian device:
client = Client("192.168.1.100")

# Connect to the device:
await client.connect()

# Run various commands:
await client.device.ping()
await client.device.diagnostics()

# Disconnect from the device â€“ notice that this is a regular method:
client.disconnect()


asyncio.run(main())
```
## Commands

Many commands are available:

* `client.device.diagnostics()`: return diagnostics info from the device
* `client.device.factory_reset()`: perform a factory reset of the device
* `client.device.ping()`: ping the device to determine whether it can be reached
* `client.device.reboot()`: reboot the device
* `client.device.upgrade_firmware()`: initiate a firmware upgrade on the device
* `client.sensor.sensor_status()`: get information from the device's onboard sensors
* `client.valve.valve_close()`: close the valve
* `client.valve.valve_halt()`: halt the valve mid-open or mid-close (be careful!)
* `client.valve.valve_open()`: open the valve
* `client.valve.valve_status()`: get information about the device's valve
* `client.valve.valve_reset()`: reset all valve diagnostics

Details on how to use each operation can be found in the docstrings for the various
methods; similarly, the test fixtures demonstrate the various types of JSON responses
you can anticipate.
