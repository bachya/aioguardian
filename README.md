`aioguardian` is a Python3, `asyncio`-focused library for interacting with
[the Guardian line of water valves and sensors from Elexa](http://getguardian.com).

# Installation

```python
pip install aioguardian
```

# Python Versions

`aioguardian` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8 

# Documentation

Complete documentation can be found here: http://aioguardian.readthedocs.io

# Usage

```python
import asyncio

from aioguardian import Client
from aioguardian.errors import GuardianError


async with Client("192.168.1.100") as client:
    # Run various commands


asyncio.run(main())
```

If the mood should strike you, you can manually instantiate a `Client` object and manage
connection to and disconnection from the device yourself:

```python
import asyncio

from aioguardian import Client
from aioguardian.errors import GuardianError


client = Client("192.168.1.100")

await client.connect()

# Run various commands

# Notice that disconnection is via a regular method, not a coroutine:
client.disconnect()


asyncio.run(main())
```
## Commands

Many commands are available:

* `client.device.diagnostics()`: return diagnostics info from the device
* `client.device.factory_reset()`: perform a factory reset of the device
* `client.device.ping()`: ping the device to determine whether it can be reached
* `client.device.publish_state()`: publish the device state to the Guardian cloud
* `client.device.reboot()`: reboot the device
* `client.device.upgrade_firmware()`: initiate a firmware upgrade on the device
* `client.device.wifi_configure()`: connect the device to an SSID
* `client.device.wifi_disable_ap()`: disable the device's onboard WiFi access point
* `client.device.wifi_enable_ap()`: enable the device's onboard WiFi access point
* `client.device.wifi_reset()`: reset all WiFi info
* `client.device.wifi_status()`: get information related to the device's WiFi connections
* `client.sensor.pair_dump()`: get information on all paired sensors
* `client.sensor.pair_sensor()`: pair a new sensor to the device
* `client.sensor.sensor_status()`: get information from the device's onboard sensors
* `client.valve.valve_close()`: close the valve
* `client.valve.valve_halt()`: halt the valve mid-open or mid-close (be careful!)
* `client.valve.valve_open()`: open the valve
* `client.valve.valve_reset()`: reset all valve diagnostics
* `client.valve.valve_status()`: get information about the device's valve

Response payload samples for each of these commands can be found in the
[`fixtures` folder](/tree/dev/tests/fixtures).
